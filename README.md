# Medical Tracker
## Issues to review

## User Story
AS A patient
I WANT to access a patient portal that stores all of my medical data
SO THAT users can conveniently store and pull up data as needed

Created a medical tracking app that allows users to log in their medication and dosage and keep a running list. Also allows users to delete and add to their stored data.
